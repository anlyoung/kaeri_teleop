1. fill in the all the parameters (x, y, z, w) in "cam_calibration" file and save

2. open terminal and go to the directory which includes "cam_calibration"

3. run "cam_calibration":
		$python cam_calibration

4. translation and quaternion will be shown up on the terminal (quaternion is in wxyz
sequence)

5. open (gedit) "kinfu3.launch" file (it is in src/kinfu_DL/launch/)

6. change the parameters in the first line (static_tf_broadcaster, 7 numbers are tr_x tr_y tr_z q_x q_y q_z q_w)

7. run kinfu3.launch:
		$roslaunch kinfu kinfu3.launch

8. open rviz:
		$rviz -d ~/.rviz/paper_test.rviz

9. check coordinates with tf
