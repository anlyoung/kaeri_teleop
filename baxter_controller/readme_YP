baxter_controller package includes 3 node:

	baxter_controller_3D_recon - baxter controller node for 3D reconstruction demo (left arm follows phantom HIP)
	baxter_controller_teleop - baxter controller node for teleoperation demo (right arm follows phantom HIP and left arm views phantom HIP)
	baxter_controller_sim - baxter controller node for simulation 


baxter_controller nodes requires ik_solver module in src folder

	ik_solver.py - solve inverse kinematics problem and send tracking command to baxter
	transformations.py - downloaded library for quaternion calculation
