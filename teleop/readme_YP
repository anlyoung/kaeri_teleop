teleop package includes no node. It has only launch and rviz config files for automatic launch of whole robotic demo system.


In current configuration, there are 2 configuration to demonstrate the system:
	2 laptops are used (laptops folder): alienware and dell precision
	2 desktops are used (desktops folder): wall_pc and dell_tower

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
In laptops folder, there are 5 launch files:
	
	dell_precision.launch - used in dell_precision laptop. Only runs phantom node in phantom_interface package
	demo_recon.launch - used on alienware laptop. Just left arm follows HIP (baxter_controller_3Drecon) for 3D reconstruction demo
	demo_teleop.launch - used on alienware laptop. baxter_controller_teleop is used for robot arm movement, and pen end effector is add on the right hand of robot model
	playing_pan_teleop.launch - used on alienware laptop. baxter_controller_teleop is used for robot arm movement, and foam_cutter end effector is add on the right hand of robot model
	sim_teleop.launch - used on alienware laptop. baxter_controller_sim is used for robot arm movement(baxter_world.launch of baxter_gazebo package should be executed on dell_precision laptop beforehand, and sim_baxter.sh should be used to be connected to simulation on alienware laptop).

	1. when you demonstrate 3D reconstruction:
		- dell_precision: baxter.sh -> dell_precision.launch
		- alienware: baxter.sh -> demo_recon.launch

	2. when you demonstrate teleoperation:
		- dell_precision: baxter.sh -> dell_precision.launch
		- alienware: baxter.sh -> demo_teleop.launch

	3. when you demonstrate foam cutting (playing_pan):
		- dell_precision: baxter.sh -> dell_precision.launch
		- alienware: baxter.sh -> playing_pan_teleop.launch

	4. when you demonstrate teleoperation with simulation(gazebo):
		- dell_precision: baxter.sh sim -> baxter_world.launch (in baxter_gazebo package, terminal 1)
											baxter.sh sim -> dell_precision.launch (terminal 2)
		- alienware: sim_baxter.sh -> sim_teleop.launch

In desktops folder, there are 8 launch files:
	
	demo_recon_~.launch - Just left arm follows HIP (baxter_controller_3Drecon) for 3D reconstruction demo
	demo_teleop_~.launch -baxter_controller_teleop is used for robot arm movement, and pen end effector is add on the right hand of robot model
	playing_pan_teleop_~.launch - baxter_controller_teleop is used for robot arm movement, and foam_cutter end effector is add on the right hand of robot model
	sim_teleop_~.launch - baxter_controller_sim is used for robot arm movement(baxter_world.launch of baxter_gazebo package should be executed on dell_tower pc beforehand, and sim_baxter.sh should be used to be connected to simulation on wall_pc).

	1. when you demonstrate 3D reconstruction:
		- dell_tower: baxter.sh -> demo_recon_dell_tower.launch

	2. when you demonstrate teleoperation:
		- dell_tower: baxter.sh -> demo_teleop_dell_tower.launch
		- wall_pc: baxter.sh -> demo_teleop_wall_pc.launch

		- dell_tower: baxter.sh -> playing_pan_teleop_dell_tower.launch
		- wall_pc: baxter.sh -> playing_pan_teleop_wall_pc.launch

	4. when you demonstrate teleoperation with simulation(gazebo):
		- dell_tower: baxter.sh sim -> baxter_world.launch (in baxter_gazebo package, terminal 1)
									baxter.sh sim -> sim_teleop_dell_tower.launch (terminal 2)
		- wall_pc: sim_baxter_desktop.sh -> sim_teleop_wall_pc.launch
