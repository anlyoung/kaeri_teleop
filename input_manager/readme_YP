input_manager package includes 1 node:

	input_manager


This package has keyboard module in src folder, but now it is not used anymore.
At first, I tried to make a program which can get keyboard input as a background program so that it can read keyboard input even if it's terminal is not activated.
The keyboard module can access X11 of ubuntu and gather all the keyboard and mouse input. 
However, it needs sudo authority to access X11, and it conflicts with baxter.sh, so now we are not using it. 
You may be able to interact with baxter without baxter.sh by modifying ROS_master_URI. Then, I recommend you to change code to use keyboard module.
